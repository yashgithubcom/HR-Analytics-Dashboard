# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee data, tracking key metrics like turnover rates, employee performance, diversity, and hiring trends. It uses interactive visuals to identify patterns and insights, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions to enhance workforce management and strategic planning.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** To initiate the analysis, I identified essential KPIs for tracking and assessing employee performance and attrition. These KPIs were represented using card visualizations in Power BI:

- Employee Count
- Attrition
- Attrition Rate
- Average Age
- Average Income
- Average Tenure

**Charts and Insights:**

I utilized various charts and visualizations to extract insights from the employee data. Below are some of the key observations:

- **Tree Map Chart:** This chart illustrated the attrition distribution by gender. It revealed that 140 males and 79 females had left the company, indicating a higher attrition rate among male employees.
  
- **Pie Chart:** This chart depicted attrition by education field. The data showed that the Life Sciences field had the highest attrition rate at 38%, followed by the Medical field at 27%.

- **Stacked Column Chart:** The chart demonstrated attrition by age group, highlighting that the 26-35 age group had the highest attrition count of 116.

- **Matrix Table:** This table displayed job roles by job satisfaction scores, emphasizing significant figures in red. The data indicated that laboratory technicians had the highest attrition rate, followed by sales executives and research scientists.

- **Funnel Chart:** This chart showed attrition by monthly salary slabs. The data revealed that the highest attrition occurred in the salary slab up to 5K, which is below the company's average income of 6.5K.

- **Area Chart:** This chart showed attrition by years of service in the company. The data indicated that attrition peaked after the first year, then again after 10 years, and finally after 5 years of service.

- **Stacked Bar Chart:** The chart highlighted the top three job roles with the highest attrition counts. Laboratory technicians topped the list with 62, followed by sales executives and research scientists.

- **Filters:** Department filters were incorporated at the top of the dashboard, allowing users to filter the entire dashboard by selecting a specific department.

**Suggestions for Improving Employee Performance and Retention:**

- Investigate the underlying causes of the higher attrition rate among male employees and take appropriate actions to address their concerns and needs.
  
- Identify the primary factors contributing to the high attrition rate in the Life Sciences and Medical fields, and implement strategies to retain employees in these areas.
  
- Address the issues faced by employees in the 26-35 age group, who have the highest attrition rate, and provide them with better opportunities for career growth and development.
  
- Review the job roles with the highest attrition rates, such as laboratory technicians, sales executives, and research scientists, to understand the causes of high attrition and take the necessary steps to address these issues.
  
- Assess the companyâ€™s salary structure, particularly for employees earning up to 5K, and consider making salary adjustments to enhance market competitiveness.
  
- Offer training and development opportunities to help employees improve their skills and advance their careers, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and reduced attrition.
  
- Foster a supportive work environment, provide work-life balance opportunities, and recognize and reward employee contributions to boost engagement and retention.
